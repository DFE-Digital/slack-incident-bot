# IO::Stream

Provide a buffered stream implementation for Ruby, independent of the underlying IO.

[![Development Status](https://github.com/socketry/io-stream/workflows/Test/badge.svg)](https://github.com/socketry/io-stream/actions?workflow=Test)

## Usage

Please see the [project documentation](https://socketry.github.io/io-stream) for more details.

## Releases

Please see the [project releases](https://socketry.github.io/io-streamreleases/index) for all releases.

### v0.10.0

  - Rename `done?` to `finished?` for clarity and consistency.

### v0.9.1

  - Fix EOF behavior to match Ruby IO semantics: `read()` returns empty string `""` at EOF while `read(size)` returns `nil` at EOF.

### v0.9.0

  - Add support for `buffer` parameter in `read`, `read_exactly`, and `read_partial` methods to allow reading into a provided buffer.

### v0.8.0

  - On Ruby v3.3+, use `IO#write` directly instead of `IO#write_nonblock`, for better performance.
  - Introduce support for `Readable#discard_until` method to discard data until a specific pattern is found.

### v0.7.0

  - Split stream functionality into separate `Readable` and `Writable` modules for better modularity and composition.
  - Remove unused timeout shim functionality.
  - 100% documentation coverage.

### v0.6.1

  - Fix compatibility with Ruby v3.3.0 - v3.3.6 where broken `@io.close` could hang.

### v0.6.0

  - Improve compatibility of `gets` implementation to better match Ruby's IO\#gets behavior.

### v0.5.0

  - Add support for `read_until(limit:)` parameter to limit the amount of data read.
  - Minor documentation improvements.

### v0.4.3

  - Add comprehensive tests for `buffered?` method on `SSLSocket`.
  - Ensure TLS connections have correct buffering behavior.
  - Improve test suite organization and readability.

### v0.4.2

  - Add external test suite for better integration testing.
  - Update dependencies and improve code style with RuboCop.
